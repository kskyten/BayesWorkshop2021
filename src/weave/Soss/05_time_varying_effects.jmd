## Time varying effects and structured priors

We haven't looked at how cockroach complaints change over time. Let's look at whether there's any pattern over time.

```julia

```

We might augment our model with a log-additive monthly effect, $\texttt{mo}_t$.

$$
\eta_{b,t} = \mu_b + \kappa_b \, \texttt{traps}_{b,t} + \texttt{mo}_t + \text{log_sq_foot}_b
$$

We have complete freedom over how to specify the prior for $\texttt{mo}_t$. There are several competing factors for how the number of complaints might change over time. It makes sense that there might be more roaches in the environment during the summer, but we might also expect that there is more roach control in the summer as well. Given that we're modeling complaints, maybe after the first sighting of roaches in a building, residents are more vigilant, and thus complaints of roaches would increase.

This can be a motivation for using an autoregressive prior for our monthly effects. The model is as follows:

$$
\texttt{mo}_t \sim \text{Normal}(\rho \, \texttt{mo}_{t-1}, \sigma_\texttt{mo}) \\
\equiv \\
\texttt{mo}_t = \rho \, \texttt{mo}_{t-1} +\epsilon_t , \quad \epsilon_t \sim \text{Normal}(0, \sigma_\texttt{mo}) \\
\quad \rho \in [-1,1]
$$

This equation says that the monthly effect in month $t$ is directly related to the last month's monthly effect. Given the description of the process above, it seems like there could be either positive or negative associations between the months, but there should be a bit more weight placed on positive $\rho$s, so we'll put an informative prior that pushes the parameter $\rho$ towards 0.5.

Before we write our prior, however, we have a problem: Stan doesn't implement any densities that have support on $[-1,1]$. We can use variable transformation of a raw variable defined on $[0,1]$ to to give us a density on $[-1,1]$. Specifically,

$$
\rho_{\text{raw}} \in [0, 1] \\
\rho = 2 \times \rho_{\text{raw}} - 1
$$

Then we can put a beta prior on $\rho_\text{raw}$ to push our estimate towards 0.5.

One further wrinkle is that we have a prior for $\texttt{mo}_t$ that depends on $\texttt{mo}_{t-1}$. That is, we are working with the *conditional* distribution of $\texttt{mo}_t$ given $\texttt{mo}_{t-1}$. But what should we do about the prior for $\texttt{mo}_1$, for which we don't have a previous time period in the data?

We need to work out the *marginal* distribution of the first observation. Thankfully we can use the fact that AR models are stationary, so $\text{Var}(\texttt{mo}_t) = \text{Var}(\texttt{mo}_{t-1})$ and $\mathbb{E}(\texttt{mo}_t) = \mathbb{E}(\texttt{mo}_{t-1})$ for all $t$. Therefore the marginal distribution of $\texttt{mo}_1$ is the same as the marginal distribution of any $\texttt{mo}_t$.

First we derive the marginal variance of $\texttt{mo}_{t}$.

$$
\text{Var}(\texttt{mo}_t) = \text{Var}(\rho \texttt{mo}_{t-1} + \epsilon_t)  \\
\text{Var}(\texttt{mo}_t) = \text{Var}(\rho \texttt{mo}_{t-1}) + \text{Var}(\epsilon_t)
$$
 where the second line holds by independence of $\epsilon_t$ and $\epsilon_{t-1})$. Then, using the fact that $Var(cX) = c^2Var(X)$ for a constant $c$ and the fact that, by stationarity, $\textrm{Var}(\texttt{mo}_{t-1}) = \textrm{Var}(\texttt{mo}_{t})$, we then obtain:

$$
\text{Var}(\texttt{mo}_t)= \rho^2 \text{Var}( \texttt{mo}_{t})  + \sigma_\texttt{mo}^2 \\
\text{Var}(\texttt{mo}_t) = \frac{\sigma_\texttt{mo}^2}{1 - \rho^2}
$$

For the mean of $\texttt{mo}_t$ things are a bit simpler:

$$
\mathbb{E}(\texttt{mo}_t) = \mathbb{E}(\rho \, \texttt{mo}_{t-1} + \epsilon_t) \\
\mathbb{E}(\texttt{mo}_t) = \mathbb{E}(\rho \, \texttt{mo}_{t-1}) + \mathbb{E}(\epsilon_t) \\
$$
Since $\mathbb{E}(\epsilon_t) = 0$ by assumption we have

$$
\mathbb{E}(\texttt{mo}_t) = \mathbb{E}(\rho \, \texttt{mo}_{t-1})  + 0\\
\mathbb{E}(\texttt{mo}_t) = \rho \, \mathbb{E}(\texttt{mo}_{t}) \\
\mathbb{E}(\texttt{mo}_t) - \rho \mathbb{E}(\texttt{mo}_t) = 0  \\
\mathbb{E}(\texttt{mo}_t) = 0/(1 - \rho)
$$

which for $\rho \neq 1$ yields $\mathbb{E}(\texttt{mo}_{t}) = 0$.

We now have the marginal distribution for $\texttt{mo}_{t}$, which, in our case, we will use for $\texttt{mo}_1$. The full AR(1) specification is then:

$$
\texttt{mo}_1 \sim \text{Normal}\left(0, \frac{\sigma_\texttt{mo}}{\sqrt{1 - \rho^2}}\right) \\
\texttt{mo}_t \sim \text{Normal}\left(\rho \, \texttt{mo}_{t-1}, \sigma_\texttt{mo}\right) \forall t > 1
$$

### Fit the model

```julia

```

In the interest of brevity, we won't go on expanding the model, though we certainly could. What other information would help us understand the data generating process better? What other aspects of the data generating process might we want to capture that we're not capturing now?

As usual, we run through our posterior predictive checks.

```julia

```

```julia

```

As we can see, our monthly random intercept has captured a monthly pattern across all the buildings. We can also compare the prior and posterior for the autoregressive parameter to see how much we've learned. Here are two different ways of comparing the prior and posterior visually:

```julia

```


It looks as if our model finally generates a reasonable posterior predictive distribution for all numbers of traps, and appropriately captures the tails of the data generating process.

## Using our model: Cost forecasts

Our model seems to be fitting well, so now we will go ahead and use the model to
help us make a decision about how many traps to put in our buildings. We'll make
a forecast for 6 months forward.

```julia


```

An important input to the revenue model is how much revenue is lost due to each
complaint. The client has a policy that for every 10 complaints, they'll call an
exterminator costing the client \$100, so that'll amount to $10 per complaint.

```julia

```

Below we've generated our revenue curves for the buildings. These charts will
give us precise quantification of our uncertainty around our revenue projections
at any number of traps for each building.

A key input to our analysis will be the cost of installing bait stations. We're
simulating the number of complaints we receive over the course of a year, so we
need to understand the cost associated with maintaining each bait station over
the course of a year. There's the cost attributed to the raw bait station, which
is the plastic housing and the bait material, a peanut-buttery substance that's
injected with insecticide. The cost of maintaining one bait station for a year
plus monthly replenishment of the bait material is about $20.

```julia

```

We'll also need labor for maintaining the bait stations, which need to be
serviced every two months. If there are fewer than five traps, our in-house
maintenance staff can manage the stations (about one hour of work every two
months at $20/hour), but above five traps we need to hire outside pest control
to help out. They're a bit more expensive, so we've put their cost at $30 /
hour. Each five traps should require an extra person-hour of work, so that's
factored in as well. The marginal person-person hours above five traps are at
the higher pest-control-labor rate.

```julia

```

We can now plot curves with number of traps on the x-axis and profit/loss forecasts and uncertainty intervals on the y-axis.

```julia

```

We can can see that the optimal number of bait stations differs by building.

<br>

Left as an exercise for the reader:

  * How would we build a revenue curve for a new building?
  * Let's say our utility function is revenue. If we wanted to maximize expected

revenue, we can take expectations at each station count for each building, and choose the trap numbers that maximizes expected revenue. This will be called a maximum revenue strategy. How can we generate the distribution of portfolio revenue (i.e. the sum of revenue across all the buildings) under the maximum revenue strategy from the the draws of `rev_pred` we already have?

## Gaussian process instead of AR(1)

### Joint density for AR(1) process

We can derive the joint distribution for the AR(1) process before we move to the Gaussian process (GP) which will give us a little more insight into what a GP is. Remember that we've specified the AR(1) prior as:

$$
\begin{aligned}
\texttt{mo}_1 & \sim \text{Normal}\left(0, \frac{\sigma_\texttt{mo}}{\sqrt{1 - \rho^2}}\right) \\
\texttt{mo}_t & \sim \text{Normal}\left(\rho \, \texttt{mo}_{t-1}, \sigma_\texttt{mo}\right) \forall t > 1
\end{aligned}
$$
 Rewriting our process in terms of the errors will make the derivation of the joint distribution clearer

$$
\begin{aligned}
\texttt{mo}_1 & \sim \text{Normal}\left(0, \frac{\sigma_\texttt{mo}}{\sqrt{1 - \rho^2}}\right) \\
\texttt{mo}_t & = \rho \, \texttt{mo}_{t-1} + \sigma_\texttt{mo}\epsilon_t  \\
\epsilon_t & \sim \text{Normal}\left(0, 1\right)
\end{aligned}
$$

Given that our first term $\texttt{mo}_1$ is normally distributed, and subsequent terms are sums of normal random variables, we can see that jointly the vector, `mo`, with the $t$-th element equally the scalar $\texttt{mo}_t$, is multivariate normal, with mean zero (which we derived above). More formally, if we have a vector $x \in \mathbb{R}^M$ which is multivariate normal, $x \sim \text{MultiNormal}(0, \Sigma)$ and we left-multiply $x$ by a nonsingular matrix $L \in \mathbb{R}^{M\times M}$, $y = Lx \sim \text{MultiNormal}(0, L\Sigma L^T)$. We can use this fact to show that our vector `mo` is jointly multivariate normal.

Just as before with the noncentered parameterization, we'll be taking a vector $\texttt{mo_raw} \in \mathbb{R}^M$ in which each element is univariate $\text{Normal}(0,1)$ and transforming it into `mo`, but instead of doing the transformation with scalar transformations like in the section **Time varying effects and structured priors**, we'll do it with linear algebra operations. The trick is that by specifying each element of $\texttt{mo_raw}$ to be distributed $\text{Normal}(0,1)$ we are implicitly defining $\texttt{mo_raw} \sim \text{MultiNormal}(0, I_M)$, where $I_M$ is the identity matrix of dimension $M \times M$. Then we do a linear transformation using a matrix $L$ and assign the result to `mo` like $\texttt{mo} = L\times\texttt{mo_raw}$ so $\texttt{mo} \sim \text{MultiNormal}(0, LI_M L^T)$ and $LI_M L^T = LL^T$.

Consider the case where we have three elements in `mo` and we want to make figure out the form for $L$.

The first element of `mo` is fairly straightforward, because it mirrors our earlier parameterization of the AR(1) prior. The only difference is that we're explicitly adding the last two terms of `mo_raw` into the equation so we can use matrix algebra for our transformation.
$$
\texttt{mo}_1 = \frac{\sigma_{\texttt{mo}}}{\sqrt{1 - \rho^2}} \times \texttt{mo_raw}_1 + 0 \times \texttt{mo_raw}_2 + 0 \times \texttt{mo_raw}_3\\
$$
 The second element is a bit more complicated:

$$
\begin{aligned}
\texttt{mo}_2 & = \rho \texttt{mo}_1 + \sigma_{\texttt{mo}}\,\texttt{mo_raw}_2 + 0 \times \texttt{mo_raw}_3  \\
 & = \rho \left(\frac{\sigma_{\texttt{mo}}}{\sqrt{1 - \rho^2}} \times \texttt{mo_raw}_1\right) + \sigma_{\texttt{mo}}\,\texttt{mo_raw}_2 + 0 \times \texttt{mo_raw}_3  \\[5pt]
 & = \frac{\rho \sigma_{\texttt{mo}}}{\sqrt{1 - \rho^2}} \times \texttt{mo_raw}_1 + \sigma_{\texttt{mo}}\,\texttt{mo_raw}_2 + 0 \times \texttt{mo_raw}_3  \\
\end{aligned}
$$

While the third element will involve all three terms
$$
\begin{aligned}
\texttt{mo}_3 & = \rho \, \texttt{mo}_2 + \sigma_{\texttt{mo}}\,\texttt{mo_raw}_3 \\
 & = \rho \left(\frac{\rho \sigma_{\texttt{mo}}}{\sqrt{1 - \rho^2}} \times \texttt{mo_raw}_1 + \sigma_{\texttt{mo}}\,\texttt{mo_raw}_2\right) + \sigma_{\texttt{mo}} \texttt{mo_raw}_3  \\[5pt]
& = \frac{\rho^2 \sigma_{\texttt{mo}}}{\sqrt{1 - \rho^2}} \times \texttt{mo_raw}_1 + \rho \, \sigma_{\texttt{mo}}\,\texttt{mo_raw}_2 +  \sigma_{\texttt{mo}}\,\texttt{mo_raw}_3  \\
\end{aligned}
$$

Writing this all together:

$$
\begin{aligned}
\texttt{mo}_1 & = \frac{\sigma_{\texttt{mo}}}{\sqrt{1 - \rho^2}} \times \texttt{mo_raw}_1 + 0 \times \texttt{mo_raw}_2 + 0 \times \texttt{mo_raw}_3\\[3pt]
\texttt{mo}_2 & = \frac{\rho \sigma_{\texttt{mo}}}{\sqrt{1 - \rho^2}} \times \texttt{mo_raw}_1 + \sigma_{\texttt{mo}}\,\texttt{mo_raw}_2 + 0 \times \texttt{mo_raw}_3  \\[3pt]
\texttt{mo}_3 & = \frac{\rho^2 \sigma_{\texttt{mo}}}{\sqrt{1 - \rho^2}} \times \texttt{mo_raw}_1 + \rho \, \sigma_{\texttt{mo}}\,\texttt{mo_raw}_2 +  \sigma_{\texttt{mo}}\,\texttt{mo_raw}_3  \\
\end{aligned}
$$
 Separating this into a matrix of coefficients $L$ and the vector `mo*raw`:

$$
\texttt{mo} = \begin{bmatrix} \sigma_\texttt{mo} / \sqrt{1 - \rho^2} & 0 & 0 \\
              \rho \sigma_\texttt{mo} / \sqrt{1 - \rho^2} & \sigma_\texttt{mo} & 0 \\
              \rho^2 \sigma_\texttt{mo} / \sqrt{1 - \rho^2} & \rho \,\sigma_\texttt{mo}  & \sigma_\texttt{mo}
              \end{bmatrix} \times \texttt{mo_raw}
$$

If we multiply $L$ on the right by its transpose $L^T$, we'll get expressions for the covariance matrix of our multivariate random vector `mo`:

$$
\begin{bmatrix} \sigma_\texttt{mo} / \sqrt{1 - \rho^2} & 0 & 0 \\
\rho \sigma_\texttt{mo} / \sqrt{1 - \rho^2} & \sigma_\texttt{mo} & 0 \\
\rho^2 \sigma_\texttt{mo} / \sqrt{1 - \rho^2} & \rho \,\sigma_\texttt{mo}  & \sigma_\texttt{mo}
\end{bmatrix} \times
\begin{bmatrix} \sigma_\texttt{mo} / \sqrt{1 - \rho^2} & \rho \sigma_\texttt{mo} / \sqrt{1 - \rho^2} & \rho^2 \sigma_\texttt{mo} / \sqrt{1 - \rho^2} \\
0 & \sigma_\texttt{mo} & \rho \,\sigma_\texttt{mo} \\
0 & 0  & \sigma_\texttt{mo}
\end{bmatrix}
$$

which results in:

$$
\begin{bmatrix} \sigma^2_\texttt{mo} / (1 - \rho^2) & \rho \, \sigma^2_\texttt{mo} / (1 - \rho^2) &  \rho^2 \, \sigma^2_\texttt{mo} / (1 - \rho^2)\\
\rho \, \sigma^2_\texttt{mo} / (1 - \rho^2)  & \sigma^2_\texttt{mo} / (1 - \rho^2)  & \rho \, \sigma^2_\texttt{mo} / (1 - \rho^2) \\
\rho^2 \sigma^2_\texttt{mo} / (1 - \rho^2) & \rho \, \sigma^2_\texttt{mo} / (1 - \rho^2) & \sigma^2_\texttt{mo} / (1 - \rho^2)
\end{bmatrix}
$$
 We can simplify this result by dividing the matrix by $\sigma^2_\texttt{mo} / (1 - \rho^2)$ to get

$$
\begin{bmatrix} 1 & \rho  &  \rho^2 \\
\rho  & 1  & \rho  \\
\rho^2 & \rho & 1
\end{bmatrix}
$$

This should generalize to higher dimensions pretty easily. We could replace the Stan code in lines 59 to 63 in `src/stan/hier_NB_regression_ncp_slopes_mod_mos.stan` with the following:

```
vector[M] mo;
{
  matrix[M,M] A = rep_matrix(0, M, M);
  A[1,1] = sigma_mo / sqrt(1 - rho^2);
  for (m in 2:M)
    A[m,1] = rho^(m-1) * sigma_mo / sqrt(1 - rho^2);
  for (m in 2:M) {
    A[m,m] = sigma_mo;
    for (i in (m + 1):M)
      A[i,m] = rho^(i-m) * sigma_mo;
  }
  mo = A * mo_raw;
}
```

It's important to the note that the existing Stan code in lines 59 to 63 is doing the exact same calculations but more efficiently.

### Cholesky decomposition

Note that if we only knew the covariance matrix of our process, say a matrix called $\Sigma$, and we had a way of decomposing $\Sigma$ into $L L^T$ we wouldn't need to write out the equation for the vector. Luckily, there is a matrix decomposition called the **Cholesky decomposition** that does just that. The Stan function for the composition is called `cholesky_decompose`. Instead of writing out the explicit equation, we could do the following:

```
vector[M] mo;
{
  mo = cholesky_decompose(Sigma) * mo_raw;
}
```

provided we've defined `Sigma` appropriately elsewhere in the transformed parameter block. Note that the matrix $L$ is lower-triangular (i.e. all elements in the upper right-hand triangle of the matrix are zero).

We've already derived the covariance matrix `Sigma` for the three-dimensional AR(1) process above by explicitly calculating $L L^T$, but we can do so using the rules of covariance and the way our process is defined. We already know that each element of $\texttt{mo}_t$ has marginal variance $\sigma^2_\texttt{mo} / (1 - \rho^2)$, but we don't know the covariance of $\texttt{mo}_t$ and $\texttt{mo}_{t+h}$. We can do so recursively. First we derive the covariance for two elements of $\texttt{mo}_t$ separated by one month:

$$
\text{Cov}(\texttt{mo}_{t+1},\texttt{mo}_{t}) = \text{Cov}(\rho \, \texttt{mo}_{t} + \sigma_\texttt{mo}\epsilon_{t+1},\texttt{mo}_{t}) \\
\text{Cov}(\texttt{mo}_{t+1},\texttt{mo}_{t}) = \rho \text{Cov}(\texttt{mo}_{t},\texttt{mo}_{t}) + \sigma_\texttt{mo}\text{Cov}(\epsilon_{t+1},\texttt{mo}_{t}) \\
\text{Cov}(\texttt{mo}_{t+1},\texttt{mo}_{t}) = \rho \text{Var}(\texttt{mo}_t) + 0
$$

Then we define the covariance for $\text{Cov}(\texttt{mo}_{t+h},\texttt{mo}_{t})$ in terms of $\text{Cov}(\texttt{mo}_{t+h-1},\texttt{mo}_{t})$

$$
\text{Cov}(\texttt{mo}_{t+h},\texttt{mo}_{t}) = \text{Cov}(\rho \, \texttt{mo}_{t+h-1} + \sigma_\texttt{mo}\epsilon_{t+h},\texttt{mo}_{t}) \\
\text{Cov}(\texttt{mo}_{t+h},\texttt{mo}_{t}) = \rho \, \text{Cov}(\texttt{mo}_{t+h-1},\texttt{mo}_{t}) \\
$$
 Which we can use to recursively get at the covariance we need:

$$
\text{Cov}(\texttt{mo}_{t+h},\texttt{mo}_{t}) = \rho \, \text{Cov}(\texttt{mo}_{t+h-1},\texttt{mo}_{t}) \\
\text{Cov}(\texttt{mo}_{t+h},\texttt{mo}_{t}) = \rho \,( \rho \, \text{Cov}(\texttt{mo}_{t+h-2},\texttt{mo}_{t}) )\\
\dots \\
\text{Cov}(\texttt{mo}_{t+h},\texttt{mo}_{t}) = \rho^h \, \text{Cov}(\texttt{mo}_{t},\texttt{mo}_{t}) \\
\text{Cov}(\texttt{mo}_{t+h},\texttt{mo}_{t}) = \rho^h \, \sigma_\texttt{mo}^2/(1 - \rho^2) \\
$$
Writing this in Stan code to replace lines 59 to 63 in `src/stan/hier_NB_regression_ncp_slopes_mod_mos.stan` we would get:

```
vector[M] mo;
{
  matrix[M,M] Sigma;
  for (m in 1:M) {
    Sigma[m,m] = 1.0;
    for (i in (m + 1):M) {
      Sigma[i,m] = rho^(i - m);
      Sigma[m,i] = Sigma[i,m];
    }
  }
  Sigma = Sigma * sigma_mo^2 / (1 - rho^2);
  mo = cholesky_decompose(Sigma) * mo_raw;
}
```

### Extension to Gaussian processes

The prior we defined for `mo` is strictly speaking a Gaussian process. It is a stochastic process that is distributed as jointly multivariate normal for any finite value of $M$. Formally, we could write the above prior for `mo` like so:

$$
\begin{aligned}
  \sigma_\texttt{mo} & \sim \text{Normal}(0, 1) \\
  \rho & \sim \text{GenBeta}(-1,1,10, 5) \\
  \texttt{mo}_t & \sim \text{GP}\left( 0,
  K(t | \sigma_\texttt{mo},\rho) \right) \\
\end{aligned}
$$
 The notation :K(t | \sigma*\texttt{mo},\rho)$ defines the covariance matrix of the process over the domain $t$, which is months.

In other words:

$$
\text{Cov}(\texttt{mo}_t,\texttt{mo}_{t+h}) = k(t, t+h | \sigma_\texttt{mo}, \rho)
$$

We've already derived the covariance for our process.  What if we want to use a different definition of `Sigma`?

As the above example shows defining a proper covariance matrix will yield a proper multivariate normal prior on a parameter. We need a way of defining a proper covariance matrix. These are symmetric positive definite matrices. It turns out there is a class of functions that define proper covariance matrices, called **kernel functions**. These functions are applied elementwise to construct a covariance matrix, $K$:

$$
K_{[t,t+h]} = k(t, t+h | \theta)
$$
 where $\theta$ are the hyperparameters that define the behavior of covariance matrix.

One such function is called the __exponentiated quadratic function__, and it happens
to be implemented in Stan as `cov_exp_quad`. The function is defined as:

$$
\begin{aligned}
  k(t, t+h | \theta) & = \alpha^2  \exp \left( - \dfrac{1}{2\ell^2} ((t+h) - t)^2 \right) \\
  & = \alpha^2  \exp \left( - \dfrac{h^2}{2\ell^2} \right)
\end{aligned}
$$

The exponentiated quadratic kernel has two components to theta, $\alpha$, the marginal standard deviation of the stochastic process $f$ and $\ell$, the process length-scale.

The length-scale defines how quickly the covariance decays between time points, with large values of $\ell$ yielding a covariance that decays slowly, and with small values of $\ell$ yielding a covariance that decays rapidly. It can be seen interpreted as a measure of how nonlinear the `mo` process is in time.

The marginal standard deviation defines how large the fluctuations are on the output side, which in our case is the number of roach complaints per month across all buildings. It can be seen as a scale parameter akin to the scale parameter for our building-level hierarchical intercept, though it now defines the scale of the monthly deviations.

This kernel's defining quality is its smoothness; the function is infinitely differentiable. That will present problems for our example, but if we add some noise the diagonal of our covariance matrix, the model will fit well.

$$
k(t, t+h | \theta) = \alpha^2  \exp \left( - \dfrac{h^2}{2\ell^2} \right) + \text{if } h = 0, \, \sigma^2_\texttt{noise} \text{ else } 0
$$

### Fitting the GP model to data

```julia

R"""
fitted_model_NB_hier_gp <- sampling(comp_model_NB_hier_gp, data = stan_dat_hier, chains = 4, cores = 4, control = list(adapt_delta = 0.9))
samps_gp <- rstan::extract(fitted_model_NB_hier_gp)
"""

```

### Examining the fit

Let's look at the prior vs. posterior for the GP length scale parameter:

```julia

```

From the plot above it only looks like we learned a small amount, however we can see a bigger difference between the prior and posterior if we consider how much we learned about the ratio of `sigma_gp` to the length scale `gp_len`:

```julia

```

This is a classic problem with Gaussian processes. Marginally, the length-scale parameter isn't very well-identified by the data, but jointly the length-scale and the marginal standard deviation are well-identified.

And let's compare the estimates for the time varying parameters between the AR(1) and GP. In this case the posterior mean of the time trend is essentially the same for the AR(1) and GP priors but the 50% uncertainty intervals are narrower for the AR(1):

```julia


```

The way we coded the GP also lets us plot a decomposition of the GP into a monthly noise component (`mo_noise` in the Stan code) and the underlying smoothly varying trend (`gp_exp_quad` in the Stan code):

```julia


```
